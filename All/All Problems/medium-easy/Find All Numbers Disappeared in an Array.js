Problem Statement:
Given a list of n integers, where each integer is in the range 1 to n, some numbers appear twice and others appear once. Your task is to find all the integers from the range [1, n] that do not appear in the list.

Return the numbers that are missing from the list.

Example:
Example 1:
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [5,6]
Explanation: The numbers 5 and 6 are missing from the list.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The number 2 is missing from the list.
Notes:
You must solve this problem without using extra space (other than the input array itself), i.e., modify the input array in-place.
The algorithm should run in O(n) time.
