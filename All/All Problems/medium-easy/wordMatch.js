Problem:
You have a list of words and a string pattern. Your task is to find if a word matches the given pattern. A word matches the pattern if there is a bijection between a letter in the pattern and a letter in the word.

Return a list of all the words that match the pattern.

Example:
Input:
Words: ["deed", "moon", "good", "abba"]
Pattern: "xyyx"
Output: ["deed", "moon"]

Clarifying Points:
Length Match: All words and the pattern have the same length.
Bijection: Each letter in the pattern must map to exactly one letter in the word, and vice versa.
