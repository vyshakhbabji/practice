Problem: Given a graph representing a social network where each node is a user and edges represent friendships,
 implement a function that suggests potential friends for a given user. 
 The function should return the top 3 users who have the most mutual friends with the given user, but are not already their friends.


Clarifications: 
1, 2, 3,4, 5  --- nodes --- users 
edges ---- friendship === connected , unweighted graph , directed graph
