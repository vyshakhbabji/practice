// Time complexity: O(3^(m*n)) - Exponential
// Space complexity: O(m*n) - Recursive stack space

/*
Let's break it down:
Space complexity is still O(m * n) because we maintain a visited matrix and recursion stack space of maximum depth m * n (the size of the matrix).

Time complexity depends on the number of choices at each step. At each cell, the algorithm can potentially move in up to 4 directions. However, with backtracking, the number of recursive calls reduces since we don't revisit already visited paths.

Now, letâ€™s look at the number of recursive calls in the worst case:

If the matrix is full of 0s (no blocked cells), every cell will have 3 or 4 possible directions to explore.
The time complexity is therefore approximately O(3^(m * n)) in the worst case because for every cell, the DFS explores 3 other directions (backtracking reduces it from 4 to 3).
